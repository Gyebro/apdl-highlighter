this reference, defined as follows:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Analysis</strong></span> -- The set of input lines relating to a single
   problem. An analysis basically consists of three phases: the Preprocessing Phase, the Solution
   Phase, and the Postprocessing Phase.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Command</strong></span> -- An instruction to supply data, or control, to the
   program. Commands usually begin with a prescribed name, followed by alphanumeric data. For
   example, the command <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a>, <em class="replaceable"><code>ITYPE</code></em>,
    <em class="replaceable"><code>Ename</code></em>,&nbsp;... may be input as
    <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a>,1,<a href="../ans_elem/Hlp_E_PIPE288.html" class="olink"><span class="structname">PIPE288</span></a> stating that element type 1 is defined
   as the <a href="../ans_elem/Hlp_E_PIPE288.html" class="olink"><span class="structname">PIPE288</span></a> element. The uppercase argument name indicates that a
   numerical value is typically entered in that field, whereas an upper-lower case data label
   indicates that an alphanumeric value is typically entered in that field. Another command, for
   example, <a href="Hlp_C_PREP7.html" class="olink"><span class="command"><strong>/PREP7</strong></span></a>, instructs the program to enter the PREP7 portion of the
   program. All valid commands are alphabetically listed in the <a class="xref" href="Hlp_C_CH3.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3:&nbsp;Command Dictionary">Command Dictionary</a> of
   this document. Unrecognized commands are further processed in a macro search
    (<a href="Hlp_C_USE.html" class="olink"><span class="command"><strong>*USE</strong></span></a>) before being ignored. Commands may be indented on a line for
   clarity.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Data</strong></span> -- Data may be numeric (real or integer), alphabetic, or
   alphanumeric (containing letters and numbers). Nonnumeric data should not contain special
   characters such as</p><pre class="programlisting">!   @   #    $   %    ^   &amp;   *   (     )   _    -   +  

=   |   \   {  }   [  ]    "     '   /    &lt;     &gt;   ~    `</pre><p>Numeric data may be input in a variety of ways as described
in <a class="xref" href="Hlp_C_CH1_3.html#aq97Sq201ctg" title="1.3.1.&nbsp;Data Input">Data Input</a>. Some commands are switches of the
form <span class="bold"><strong> Commandname</strong></span>,<span class="italic"><em>Key</em></span>   where <span class="italic"><em>Key</em></span> can be 0, NO or OFF to toggle  the switch off; or 1, YES or ON to
toggle the switch on.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Degree of Freedom</strong></span> -- The degrees of freedom are the primary
   nodal unknowns determined by the analysis. They may be displacements, rotations, temperatures,
   pressures, voltages, etc. A degree of freedom is defined by a node number and a label, for
   example, 1 UX, 87 ROTZ, 4 TEMP, etc. Derived results, such as stresses, heat flows, etc. are
   computed from the degree of freedom results and are considered secondary unknowns. </p><p>Element types with unequal sets of degrees of freedom can be
combined  in a single structure.  For example, a 2-D structure composed
 of  2-D solid elements having two degrees  of freedom (UX, UY) at
each node and a 2-D beam element having three degrees of freedom (UX,
UY, ROTZ) at each node will have the latter three degrees of freedom
at the common nodes. Nodes which do not have a beam element attached
will have only two degrees of freedom with ROTZ eliminated from the
solution printout.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Field</strong></span> -- The command name and data items entered on a command
   are separated into consecutive fields. A field is assumed to be as "wide" as the number of
   characters specified. A comma is used to end one field and begin the next.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Line</strong></span> -- A line of input is a physical record read by the
   computer. Input lines are limited to 640 characters (including preceding blanks, commas, and any
   special characters). For file input, a line is represented by one 640 column data record. For
   interactive input, a line is the string of characters (640 maximum) entered before the RETURN key
   is pressed. Several commands may be put on one line as described in <a class="xref" href="Hlp_C_CH1_3.html#aq97Sq201ctg" title="1.3.1.&nbsp;Data Input">Data Input</a>. Blank lines are permitted for clarity.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Command name</strong></span> -- Only the first four characters of any
   alphabetic (or alphanumeric) command name are interpreted by the program (except as noted for
   certain commands, such as <span class="bold"><strong> /POST<em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em></strong></span>, <span class="bold"><strong>/AUX<em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em></strong></span>. <a href="Hlp_C_ENDDO.html" class="olink"><span class="command"><strong>*ENDDO</strong></span></a>, etc.). The remaining characters of the
   field are ignored. Names shown with fewer than four characters are assumed to have blanks up
   through the fourth character as part of the name. For example, this sample <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a>
   command may be input as <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a>,1,42 or <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a> ,1,42 or
    <a class="link" href="Hlp_C_ET.html" title="ET"><span class="command"><strong>ET</strong></span></a> ,1,42, but not as <span class="bold"><strong>ETABCD</strong></span>,1,42. Names may
   not contain special characters (as described in <a class="xref" href="Hlp_C_CH1_3.html#aq97Sq201ctg" title="1.3.1.&nbsp;Data Input">Data Input</a>). If the command
   name is omitted, the name defaults to the name of the previous command, unless it was a slash (/)
   or star (*) command. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Postprocessing Phase</strong></span> -- The set of commands causing further
   processing of the solution output. These commands consist of commands from the POST1 and POST26
   processors. The postprocessing phase may consist of input for several postprocessing sessions (in
   series). </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Preprocessing Phase</strong></span> -- The set of commands related to
   defining the model. The preprocessing phase consists of input from the PREP7 processor.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Program</strong></span> -- The collection of all processors (preprocessing,
   postprocessing, auxiliary, etc.) is called the ANSYS program. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Processor</strong></span> -- A group of related functions, such as model
   definition (PREP7) or results examination (POST1).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Run</strong></span> -- The collection of all commands between the
   system-level commands is called a run or session). A session may also consist of several analyses
   in series (separated by a <a href="Hlp_C_CLEAR.html" class="olink"><span class="command"><strong>/CLEAR</strong></span></a> command).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Solution Phase</strong></span> -- The set of commands which apply boundary
   conditions to the model created in preprocessing, then performs a solution for that set of
   boundary conditions. The solution phase may consist of several solutions in series, such as a
   static solution, followed by a modal solution, etc.</p></div><hr><p class="legalfooter"><small><i>Release 18.2 - &copy; ANSYS, Inc. All rights reserved.</i></small></p></body></html>
